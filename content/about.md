# About this blog site

Welcome to Clean Arch! This is my personal blog site dedicated to sharing knowledge, insights, and best practices in software development, Architecture patterns.

## About Me

Hey there! I'm a Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS Hong Kong, passionate about containers, serverless architectures, and the transformative power of Generative AI. I thrive on building scalable systems and empowering teams to harness cloud-native technologies. My philosophy? Working efficiently, clean, elegant design over unnecessary complexityâ€”which is exactly why I named this blog "Clean Arch."

Before AWS, I cut my teeth in DevOps and platform engineering across various companies in the region, learning that the best solutions often come from understanding both the technical challenges and the human stories behind them.

Outside of work, you'll find me exploring the intersection of system design, Kubernetes, platform engineering, and GenAI innovations. I believe in sharing knowledge and building communities around these technologiesâ€”hence this blog.

I'm passionate about making complex systems simple and helping others navigate the rapidly changing landscape of modern software architecture.
