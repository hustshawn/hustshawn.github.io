# About this blog site

Welcome to my technical blog! This is a platform dedicated to sharing knowledge, insights, and best practices in software development, programming, and technology.

## About Me

Hey there! I'm a Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS Hong Kong, where I spend my days diving deep into containers, serverless architectures, and the ever-evolving world of Generative AI. What gets me excited? Building systems that scale beautifully and helping teams unlock the potential of cloud-native technologies.

Before AWS, I cut my teeth in DevOps and platform engineering across various companies in the region, learning that the best solutions often come from understanding both the technical challenges and the human stories behind them.

Outside of work, you'll find me exploring the intersection of system design, Kubernetes, platform engineering, and GenAI innovations. I believe in sharing knowledge and building communities around these technologiesâ€”hence this blog.

I'm passionate about making complex systems simple and helping others navigate the rapidly changing landscape of modern software architecture.
